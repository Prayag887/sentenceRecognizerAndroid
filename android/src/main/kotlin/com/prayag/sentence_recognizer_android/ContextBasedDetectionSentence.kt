     *   "banana", "apple", "lunch", "dinner", or "breakfast".
     * - "movement": Identified by actions related to movement such as "went", "go", "walk", or "run".
     * - "group": Identified by words indicative of group references such as "we", "us", or "our".
     * - If none of these keywords are found, the context is considered "general".

     * @param sentence The input sentence whose context is to be determined.
     * @return A string representing the detected context, which could be "eating", "movement", "group", or "general".
